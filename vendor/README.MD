Chromium Depot Tools is a collection of tools built on top of Git to simplify the workflow of developers contributing to the Chromium codebase and related projects[¹](^1^). It contains tools to get the code, upload changes for review, keep your checkout up to date, and more[²](^1^)!

Some of the most important tools in Chromium Depot Tools are:

- **fetch**: [A gclient wrapper to checkout a project.](^2^)
- **gclient**: [A meta-checkout tool that manages dependencies and submodules.](^2^)
- **git cl**: [A code review tool that interacts with Rietveld or Gerrit.](^2^)
- **roll-dep**: [A gclient dependency management tool that submits a dep roll, updating a dependency to a newer revision.](^2^)

You can find more information about how to install and use Chromium Depot Tools in the [official documentation](^1^) or the [depot_tools tutorial](^5^).
